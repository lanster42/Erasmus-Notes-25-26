    "- $2.8 \\times 10^{6}$  Explanation: We want $n \\log(n) \\leq 6.0 \\times 10^7$. I will use base 2 for logarithms. I tried to use $n = 4000000$ and got a too big number, so through trial and error I got to $n \\approx 2.8 \\times 10^{6}$ and got the number: $5.996\\ldots \\times 10^{6}$ which is a good enough approximation. I followed a similar procedure for the following examples. I have also rounded values so the number of elements processed might be a bit less.\n",

The final row multiplies n with the result of function recursion(n). Multiplication is a constant operation, but the function recursion(n) is called again with argument n - 1. This means that the function will be called n times until it reaches the base case, which has constant time complexity. Therefore the time complexity is $\\mathcal{O}$(n)."
