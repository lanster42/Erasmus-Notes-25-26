    "After initialization, only 2 is in the queue. In the first loop we move 2 from the queue to the explored array and add 3 and 4 to the queue. We also remember that 2 as the predecessor of 3 and 4. In the next loop we then move 3 from the queue to the explored array, so the queue only has 4. The predecessor of 3 is 2. In the next loop we move 4 from the queue to the explored and add 5 to the queue. We also remember the predecessors of 5 are 4 and 2. In the next loop we move 5 from the queue to the explored and put 1 in the queue, remembering its predecessors. In the enxt step we move 1 from the queue to explored and end the algorithm, since the queue is now empty. We have not discovered the number 0.\n",

    "a) Proof with BFS: Let $v_1, v_2, . . . , v_(2n + 1)$ be a sequence representing an odd cycle. Then we can choose $v_1$ as the starting point of our cycle by definition. If we then color $v_1$ as color 1, we have to color $v_2$ and $v_(2n + 1)$ as color 2. We can choose $v_2$ as our next move of BFS ($v_2$ goes from the queue to explored and $v_(2n + 1)$ stays in the queue.). We then can go to only $v_3$, coloring it with color 1. Repeating this, we get all odd indexed vertices colored with color 1 and all even indexed vertices colored with color 2. So we have to color vetrex $v_(2n + 1) with color 1, but that would mean that adjacent vertices $v_1$ and $v_(2n + 1)$ would be colored with the same color. Proof follows.\n",
    "Note: We could also prove this by induction.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Let's assume that G has no odd-lenght cycles but a valid coloring doesn't exist. That means, that there is a pair of adjacent vertices with the same color. For our starting point of BFS we can use an arbitrary vertex, naming it $v_1$. We then mark the two adjacent vertices as $v_2$ and $v_2k$, since the cycle has to be even. Using the BFS algorithm, we can move along the cycle until we reach one of the adjacent same-colored vertices. If the color of the starting vertex and the adjacent same-colored vertices is the same, then the index of the first discovered same-colored vertices has to be odd (proved in a)). If we then start from $v_1$ and continue to $v_2k$, coloring it the other color, we can eventually reach the second vertex of the two adjacent same-colored vertices. We have assumed that the color of it is the same as that of $v_1$, which means that the index of it has to be odd. Contradiction. If we assume that the coloring of the two adjacent same-colored vertices is different from the coloring of $v_1$, we reach the same conclusion, which is a contradiction with the even-ness of the cycle."

    "An example of the graph G would have V = {s, a, b, c, d} and E = {s -> a, s -> b, a -> c, a -> d, b -> c, b -> d}. A good set of tree edges $E_\\pi$ would be {s -> a, s -> b, a -> c, b -> d}. This way, for each vertex the unique path from s to that vertex is the shortest path. The set of edges $E_\\pi$ cannot be produced by BFS, since when the algorithm reaches either vertex a or b, it would see both c and d as adjacent vertices, making a (or b) the predecessor of both c and d, which is not the case in the graph $(V, E_\\pi)$."
